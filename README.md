# Automated-EC2-MongoDB-Scheduled-Backup-Solution
#### This GitHub repository hosts the Source Code and Documentation for an automated backup solution designed to simplify and enhance MongoDB data backup processes running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.





## Project - "Overview":
• Providing an automated and Efficient Backup Solution that runs automatically on a pre-defined, scheduled time reducing human interventions for backup, and saving time and efforts.

• This project aimed to create a comprehensive MongoDB backup solution on an EC2 Instance within the AWS Environment.

• It involves several components and steps to ensure a robust system for MongoDB database hosted on an Amazon Web Service (AWS) EC2 Instance.

• It covers the setup of AWS resources, the installation of MongoDB, the configuration of an S3 bucket for storing backups, and the automation of the backup process.






## Project - "Problem Statement":
#### Mr. John Williams is an employee at an IT Company, He works on the Cloud Technology in the IT department. 

#### The IT company He is working in has many business divisions and as well as many domains hosted on the cloud. Mr.John has hosted a website on AWS EC2 instance along with MongoDb database. but taking backup manually is time consuming.

#### So Mr. John wants to automate taking database backup continuously without getting bogged down in different backup and failure scenarios in MongoDB database systems, He wants to utilize the time he spends on the backup task to do more productive work.







## Project - "Deliverables":
#### Mr.John wants a solution on the effective Automatic MongoDB Backup Method so that Mr.John will no longer need to spend hours on the MongoDB backup process.






## Project - "Solution":
#### Providing an automated and efficient backup solution that runs automatically on a pre-defined, scheduled time reducing human interventions for backup, and to save time & efforts.






## Project - "Planning":
#### The Project of Automating MongoDB Backups on EC2 involves using multiple applications and integration methods.
### This project is devided into "6 Main PARTS" in order to make it easy to understand.
###    PART-1 - Creating an AWS Account.   
###    PART-2 - Creating AWS IAM Credentials.
###    PART-3 - Launching an EC2-Ubuntu-Instance and Establishing a SSH Connection.
###    PART-4 - Installing MongoDB & it's Dependencies on EC2
###    PART-5 - Enabling MongoDB backup from EC2 to S3
###    PART-6 - Automating the Backup using Cronjob

# Project Execution _Guide:
## PART-1 - [Creating an AWS Account _Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFaSB6vgp8k&t=13s)  
#### AWS Cloud:
#### AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive and widely used cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of scalable and on-demand computing services, including storage, databases, machine learning, and more.

#### Use Cases:
#### Creating an AWS account is the initial step because AWS provides the infrastructure and services required for hosting the EC2 instance and S3 bucket, etc.
