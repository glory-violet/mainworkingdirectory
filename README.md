# Automated-EC2-MongoDB-Scheduled-Backup-Solution
#### This GitHub repository hosts the Source Code and Documentation for an automated backup solution designed to simplify and enhance MongoDB data backup processes running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.

## Project Problem Statement:
#### Mr. John Williams is an employee at an IT Company, He works on the Cloud Technology in the IT department. 

#### The IT company He is working in has many business divisions and as well as many domains hosted on the cloud. Mr.John has hosted a website on AWS EC2 instance along with MongoDb database. but taking backup manually is time consuming.

#### So Mr. John wants to automate taking database backup continuously without getting bogged down in different backup and failure scenarios in MongoDB database systems, He wants to utilize the time he spends on the backup task to do more productive work.


## Project Deliverables:
#### Mr.John wants a solution on the effective Automatic MongoDB Backup Method so that Mr.John will no longer need to spend hours on the MongoDB backup process.


## Project Solution:
#### Providing an automated and efficient backup solution that runs automatically on a pre-defined, scheduled time reducing human interventions for backup, and to save time & efforts.

## Project-Planning:
#### The Project of Automating MongoDB Backups on EC2 involves using multiple applications and integration methods.
### This project is devided into Multiple PARTS in order to make it easy to understand.
###    PART-1 - Creating an AWS Account
###    PART-2 - Creating IAM Account with Access Credentials.
###    PART-3 - Launching an EC2-Ubuntu-Instance:
###    PART-4 - Installing Flask Application & it's dependencies on EC2.
###    PART-5 - Installing MongoDB & it's Dependencies on EC2.
###    PART-6 - Integrating Flask-App with MongoDB.
###    PART-7 - Connecting to MongoDB using Mongo Compass.
###    PART-8 - Enabling MongoDB backup from EC2 to S3.
